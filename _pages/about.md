I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.utdallas.edu/) at [the University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/). My research interests are in Natural Language Processing, focusing on multi-document summarization, long document summarization, multimodal summarization, and applied LLM in data science. My work aims to enhance the understanding and analysis of text data, contributing to the field with innovative approaches and practical applications.

I have been working under the mentorship of [Dr. Weili Wu](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~weiliwu/). My dissertation focuses on adapting automatic summarization techniques to social networks.

I hold a Masterâ€™s degree from Peking University and a Bachelor's from Northeastern University.
